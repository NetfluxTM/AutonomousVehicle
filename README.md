# AutonomousVehicle
Arduino code for the Engineering Club robotic vehicle competition.

To reach the actual source code file, go to the "AutonomousVehicle" folder. 
The file you want is "AutonomousVehicle.ino".    
You should be able to open this file with the arduino IDE, or you can simply edit the code in github.

The other files and folders you see are unimportant background files for Visual Studio,
you don't need to pay attention to them.

Remember to save any changes to github if you download the file! Otherwise no one else will be able to see what you added.
